Dynamic Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Monitoring

## Motivation
By sharing this repository, we aim to provide a toolset on how to build and maintain a traceable and updated dataset for entrepreneurial ecosystem research, using puplicly available data. We combine different data sources to detect startups at a very early stage, follow the startup cohort over time, and to create a comprehensive dataset that allows us to apply AI models in the future. We encourage fellow scholars to create similar datasets in other contexts, allowing for panel studies, applying comparable entrepreneurial ecosystem measures and advancing the research program by providing more data-centric approaches to study the entrepreneurial ecosystem phenomenon.
